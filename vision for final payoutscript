Right now the functionalities of the payout script are limited. In the config file I have already specified some functions that I want added \
to better serve and help other delegates.

Here I will specifiy a todo list for people willing to contribute:

1. BLACKLIST integration. This needs to be performed at the calculation level when parsing the blockchain
2. BALANCE_BRACKETS. Currently TIMESTAMP_BRACKETS allow you to set a higher share for early voters, depending on timestamps. BALANCE_BRACKETS \
should allow you to do the same based on a users balance:  E.G. 200k Ark > 80% share, 100k Ark 90% Share, 50K Ark 96% Share
3. MAX and MIN balance need to be integrated at the calculation level to exclude certain voters (MIN_BALANCE), and allow voters to only vote \ 
with a maximal amount of Ark.
4. COVER_VOTING_FEES: I will probably add this myself, but basically a delegate should be able to allocate a certain amount of Ark each week to automatically \
cover someones voting fee. Restrictions need to be applied (so only once per account for example), as well as people removing their Ark balance shortly after should have \
1 ark removed from their next payout and allocate that to their delegate.
5. Write a comprehensive guide for complete tech illiterates on how to create a node with a read-only role in the Ark-DB and setup the script using bash
